"""pyquarium, by Alexander Walters <https://github.com/awinstonw>,
adapted from Al Sweigart's, <https://alsweigart.com>, fishtank.py script
in *The Big Book of Small Python Projects*. The code has been refactored
to be more object oriented and I made some minor edits to the visual
presentation of the sandy bottom and the logic for determining where the
individual aquarium member objects spawn and in what z-order, and how
the screen is refreshed.
Additionally, I added a CLI.
